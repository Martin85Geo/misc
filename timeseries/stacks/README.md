Timeseries Stack Utilities
=========================

# plot_stack_nobs.py
This script file will generate diagnostic plot of your timeseries. The plot shows the year on the X axis and the day of year on the Y axis of all images within the timeseries. If desired, it can use the Fmask band in each stack image to calculate the clear percentage of each image and display this clear percentage as a range from red (0%) to green (100%) on your output plot.
